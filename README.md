## Introduction

Road traffic injuries are a leading cause of death and disability. In low and middle income countries, vulnerable road users are commonly involved in crashes with severe injuries. Road traffic injuries are a major public health problem globally. About 1.2 million people are killed and more than 50 million are injured due to road traffic crashes annually.More than 90% of these deaths and injuries occur in low and middle income countries (LMIC) due to rapid motorization, lack of road safety culture, poor road conditions, and lack of education on road safety. Our aim is to reduce road accidents using machine learning techniques.

## Problem
The prevailing strategies are not sufficient enough to reduce the **frequency** and **severity** of road accidents.

## Motivations
- The Daily death toll from road accidents
- Inefficiency of  police traffic management
- Difficulty in handling the casualties in hospitals.

## Objectives
- Reduce Road Accidents
- To identify the main factors associated with a road  accident (accident data analysis).

## Solution
An online system to provide more accurate information on road accidents (both analysis and predictions). We are going to build a real time web application which can be used by the public without logging to the system.

## Future work

### Robust Data Handling
- Datasets with different attributes
- Resulting in a more accurate and up-to-date mode

### Realtime Modeling
- Users can analyze and predict on their own datasets
